# Reading Notes 14b

## Project Ideas
I want to broaden my horizons and try to make a game. I do not have any specific ideas, but it would be fun to use an interactive format like a game rendered to a canvas on the browser. I would also find it very neat to use a database to store the save-state, for continued playability. A login with usernames and hashed passwords would also be a fun thing to implement into the project. I also would like to use an API if possible. Maybe there is an API that renders sprites that could be used as characters in a game. An arcade style game that logs progress and has an interactive forum would be a neat idea. Obviously a lot of these 'big-time' features would have to be jerry-rigged together using whatever knowledge we have at our disposal, but it would lend itself to the bounteous use of creativity.
