# Reading Notes 05

## Heroku

Heroku is another platform that allows people to deploy websites. Unlike github pages, Heroku allows you to write your own code to do the deployment. It allows code to be deployed from cloud-based location that is used for an application. In the case of our class we are using it to deploy our own website. We will be using Node.js to handle all of the functions as well as another library called express that listens for requests at a port (localhost: 3000 for example), and then returns information that we specify in a response to the request.
