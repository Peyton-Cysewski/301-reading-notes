## Node JS

Node js is a javascript runtime. It was built on the foundation of Google Chrome's V8 engine. It was originally built for web browsing, but added a file system API, HTTP, and even more operating system abilities. This effectively means that Node allows code that is run in browser application to be run locally on your own computer.
