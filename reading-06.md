## Node JS

Node js is a javascript runtime. It was built on the foundation of Google Chrome's V8 engine. It was originally built for web browsing, but added a file system API, HTTP, and even more operating system abilities. This effectively means that Node allows code that is normally run in browser application to be run locally on your own computer.

In specific, Node is run on Google's V8 engine that was designed to run Chrome and other Chromium based applications. This infers tha it was built with performance in mind. Node can be downloaded directly from its website, but it is probably the better option to use npm, a package manager, to do the installation for you. This method automatically checks for dependencies (of which there almost always are) and adds them to the directory with the javascript files tha tyou are trying to run.

One of the big advantages of using Node is that it allows server communication to occur in the same language as the front end. This is good for humans as it can simplify life, but the integration for computers becomes evenmore seemless.
