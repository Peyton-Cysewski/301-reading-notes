## Mustache Templating

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. This is a logic-less syntax because there are logical statements; only tags are used. These tags will have either a single vallue, series of values, or nothing. `mustache.js` is an implementation of this template system in JavaScript.
Note: Mustache is not a templating engine, but a specification for a templating engine.
- Example from reading: `Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” }); // returns: Hello, Sherlynn`
