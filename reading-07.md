## REST

REST is essentially the online model in which everything universally follows the same model. If every web application followed a congruent model, the intercommunication with other machines and web applications would be seemless. In the world right now there are applications that follow this model, but not all of them. Many, many web apps have specifically written code that is not unuvesally translatable. For examples, a website that makes sense to a human would need to be translated to a different format for a computer to read. A RESTful website would have that a behind-the-scenes computer language that would makes sense an be universally translateable to computers. In an ideal RESTful internet world, these two things would be integrated by nature in design, allowing ease for humans and machines simultaneously.
