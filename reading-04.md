# Reading Notes 04

## CSS Grid

`display: grid` is a CSS property that has a lot of power. It can set a grid over an element and then choose which 'cells' to span across. The columns and rows can all be divided into whatever groupings using any length measurements. Grid adds a new length measurement called `fr` which takes up its ratio compared to the other `fr` components. Each item can also be overlapped separately and ordering within its rows.

## RegEx

Regular expressions, or ReGex is a concept that is implemented in almost every language. It's purpose is to be able to look through strings of regular language or regualr expressions and find specified groupings of characters. This can be done with any languages' code, but ReGex is actually a better way of doing so despite it's archaic look and feel.
