## Introduction

Hello, my name is Peyton Cysewski. This repository will be filled with notes from the various readings that are done during the CodeFellows Code 301 Course. The goal is for each entry to be clear and offer a summary of the reading that can be referenced by me later or for another person to see and learn from.
